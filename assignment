Home Assignment: SRE Engineer
Hello,
Thank you for your interest in the SRE Engineer position with Opus Major!
The goal of this home assignment is to assess your ability to design and deploy a simple,
production-like environment using modern DevOps and SRE practices. We are also
evaluating your understanding of the requirements and your ability to prioritize the aspects
most relevant to the role. If anything is unclear, please don
’t hesitate to ask questions.
Objectives
Your company operates a simple API that stores and retrieves player data for a multiplayer
game.
You
’
ve been tasked with deploying a minimal version of this service to a Kubernetes cluster
using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
The project should be capable of running in-cluster with ArgoCD for deployment
management.
You may use Minikube for local testing. While ArgoCD must be installed for deployment, its
installation and configuration do not need to be included in the project or documentation.
Deliverable
Your project should include the following components:
●
Golang Service:
A very simple Go application exposing a single HTTP GET endpoint at /player-data
The API returns static data, this is just a dummy endpoint that we will expose later.
●
Containerization:
The service must be containerized using Docker. Include a Dockerfile in the
repository and publish the built image to a public docker repository.
●
Deployment with ArgoCD:
Create an ArgoCD Application that deploys the service using Kustomize.

●
●
Service Exposure:
Expose the application so it can be accessed locally after deployment via ArgoCD.
You may use a Kubernetes Service, Ingress, or Gateway.
Documentation
Write a concise README.md (max 1 page) explaining:
- The overall architecture
- How to deploy everything
- Any trade-offs or assumptions due to time limits
Criteria (How we’ll evaluate)
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
●
Reasoning and Prioritization
Understanding the requirements, identifying and determining what the priorities are and
spending the time on topics that have the most impact.
●
Functionality
The service should build, deploy, and run successfully on a Kubernetes cluster. The
/update-player-data endpoint should respond correctly when accessed.
●
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Quality
Use of declarative configuration and Kustomize best practices will be assessed. We
’ll look for
clear structure, reusability, and adherence to Kubernetes conventions.
●
ArgoCD Integration
The ArgoCD Application should correctly deploy and manage the service. We
’ll verify that
synchronization, health status, and deployment automation work as expected.
●
Documentation & Clarity
Instructions for building, deploying, and testing the application locally should be clear and
concise. A short README explaining how to run the project will be expected.
●
Bonus Points
Additional attention to observability (e.g., basic logging, health checks) or good use of
Kubernetes patterns will be viewed positively but are not mandatory.
